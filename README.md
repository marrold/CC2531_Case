This is my first attempt at making a "case" for the CC2531 Zigbee Sniffer USB Stick. The cutout should make it compatible with CC2531s with and without external antennas.

This is currently a work in progress so your mileage may vary.

## Assembly

- Laser cut the base and top plate out of ~3mm acrylic.
- Mount CC2531 to base plate with adhesive strips or hot melt glue. The holes in the base plate should accomodate the THT USB Connector, allowing the board to sit flush.
- Use M3 PCB Mounts to join the base and top plate.
